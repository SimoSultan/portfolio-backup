## Description

This is my first portfolio website. It was developed in little over 1 week for a piece of assessment for my bootcamp course at [Coder Academy](https://coderacademy.edu.au). This site will live on after the assignment, just maybe not exactly in this format. I think a rewrite is in order, especially after we learn Rails and I delve more into JavaScript.


---


## Motivation

I first went searching for inspiration on [awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/). I came across the [agora.pe](https://www.agora.pe/) website, which has must have been updated in the past week actually as it is different. [This image](https://github.com/SimoSultan/portfolio-website/blob/master/docs/inspiration/main_design.jpg) is what the website looked like at time of design. The blue with a bright contrasting colour (their orange, my yellow) was something I took away that gave the site a lot of character. Apart from the slick animations they use, this was how I wanted my website to similarly look. However, due to time management, the amount of animations were dropped. I feel I came away with a similar and basic design of how I wanted my site to look. I am not happy with my footer, however it serves its purpose without looking completely ugly. This will be redesigned in future updates.

## Target Audience

Anyone at all. I didn't want to target anyone as this site should be able to be used by anybody if they were linked to it. At the moment, there are still some much needed UX improvements needed so people don't get lost and can easily understand the layout of the site.

## Design and Implementation & Project Timeline

### Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

JS was used to jump to a certain section of the home page for quick navigation for UX, and also it was implemented in the scrollbar due to cross-browser support.

The mini mood board I created for inspiration on specific elements on the page.

> ### Mood Board

The images I collected on Unsplash that helped spark some ideas. The final picture I used, seen as the one with the yellow cable in it, gave me my 2 secondary colours to use on the site. Something with nice contrast to give the page some character.

> ### Wireframes
All pages had a portrait and landscape wireframe so I can best understand how to lay out the elements when building them.

## Resources

This external code I used in my site was for the scroll bar and the 404 page. I find the default scrollbars hideous so for most modern sites, so it was a must for me to include. Also, a simple and fun 404 page was something I didn't want to reinvent the wheel on, so I decided to use a free template.
